# Waybridge frontend coding challenge

Welcome to the Waybridge frontend coding challenge! Please read the following instructions carefully.


# The Story

Monique runs a very successful manufacturing business making widgets. These
widgets are so popular that Monique has a hard time keeping up with demand.
Monique inherited a tool that displays information about her inventory, but she
does not find it very helpful. Your job is to build a better tool or improve
upon the existing app. Monique will use this tool to search through her
inventory, find out of stock items, and find items that are low on inventory so
she can order replacements.


# Use cases - Monique should be able to:

- See all of her inventory
- Search through her inventory
- Be notified of items out of stock
- Be notified of items that are low on stock


# Evaluation criteria

## Technology requirements

**React** and **JavaScript** are mandatory requirements. Apart from this, you
can use any libraries, task runners and build processors. ES6 and TypeScript are
highly encouraged.


## Grading requirements

- Is the code easy to follow and reuse?
- Does the code demonstrate an understanding of React best practices?
- Is the user experience of the app awesome?
  - Are there any bugs?
  - Is the inventory information easy to digest?
- Is the code documented nicely?
- Is the code well-tested?
- Does the app meet product requirements?


# Getting started

- Clone this repository.
- Complete your project as described above within your local repository.


# Submission

- Create a git bundle: `git bundle create your_name.bundle --all`
- Email the bundle file to your point of contact.


# How to run the API server

The boilerplate includes a small service for data fetching. The file
`server/server.json` includes all the necessary data to achieve the goal. Please
follow the steps below to start the server:

```
yarn or npm install .
yarn server or npm run server
```

Check [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) for more information.


# Time limit

There is no hard time limit for this coding challenge. However, we believe that
4-5 hours is sufficient to satisfy 
[Monique's use cases](#use-cases-monique-should-be-able-to) for the tool. While 
we appreciate all the effort put into the challenge, we also do not want to take 
up too much of your time. Our advice is to focus on making sure that the 
application works properly & has some tests, and then moving on to crush the other 
[Grading requirements](#grading-requirements). And please include some comments 
about what you would like to improve if given more time. Happy coding!


# Questions

Collaboration is a big part of the culture at Waybridge and we're very happy to
answer any questions that you have about the challenge.
